### Hi there 👋
I am Ashwini Nagaraju, Data Analyst who talks to databases more often than humans (and sometimes gets better answers). When I’m not wrestling with SQL joins or teaching Python to behave, I’m usually:  

 🧹 Cleaning messy data like it’s a crime scene investigation  
 📊 Building dashboards that make stakeholders say “wait…that’s *our* data?”  
 ⚙️ Automating reports so nobody has to suffer through Excel copy-paste marathons  
 🚀 Sneaking machine learning into business problems just to see what happens  

I believe every dataset has a story: sometimes it’s a romance (customer loyalty), sometimes a thriller (fraud detection), and sometimes… just bad reality TV (dirty logs).
